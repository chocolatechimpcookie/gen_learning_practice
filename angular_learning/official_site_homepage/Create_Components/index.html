<!--Directives
Directives is a unique and powerful feature available only in Angular. Directives
let you invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application.

Reusable Components
We use directives to create reusable components. A component allows you to
hide complex DOM structure, CSS, and behavior. This lets you focus either on what
the application does or how the application looks separately.

Localization
An important part of serious apps is localization. Angular's locale aware filters
and stemming directives give you building blocks to make your application available in
all locales.-->
