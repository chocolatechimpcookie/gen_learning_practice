<!--Deep Linking
A deep link reflects where the user is in the app, this
is useful so users can bookmark and email links to locations
within apps. Round trip apps get this automatically, but AJAX
apps by their nature do not. AngularJS combines the benefits of
deep link with desktop app-like behavior.'

Form Validation
Client-side form validation is an important part of great user experience.
AngularJS lets you declare the validation rules of the form without having
to write JavaScript code. Write less code, go have beer sooner.


Server Communication
AngularJS provides built-in services on top of XHR as well as various other
backends using third party libraries. Promises further simplify your code by
handling asynchronous return of data. In this example, we use the AngularFire
library to wire up a Firebase backend to a simple Angular app.-->
