I am using Cypress End To End framework. This requires NodeJS and NPM as well as installing Cypress.

1) Install NodeJS and NPM for your appropriate platform.
2) Open BASH or Node.js command prompt and change directory to inside this folder.
3) Run "npm install cypress" OR "npm install" in this directory
4) Then run "npm run cypress:open" in this directory
5) When cypress opens in a new window click bitly.js . Watch the tests run!
